##### Book-My-Show-Python-Project
#####We enjoy going to the movies. But do you know how do you virtually select a Ticket and book it. How does it not show the #####seats which are booked? How does it cut cost according to certain scenarios for certain seats and rows? 
#####It would be interesting to mimic that. Isnâ€™t it?
#####That is what we have done!
A cinema Hall with 7 Rows and 8 seats. The S shows the Vacant Seat here and the B shows the Reserved Seat. 

When I buy a Ticket It will ask you the row number and column number for the ticket you are booking. On the basis of the Rules it should show you the Price for that seat and ask If you want to book it.
If you choose Yes, it should take details of Name, Gender, Age and Phone No. and finally It should print Booked Successfully

When I choose the 3rd option for statistics.
It should show me the following things:-
Number of Purchased Tickets
Percentage of Tickets booked
Current Income
Total Income

The ticket price is determined by the following rules:
If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the rest 5 rows.

When I choose the 4th option:
It should ask me the row and column number.
If that row and column is booked, show the Name, gender, age, Ticket Price and Phone No.
